This is a simple project to practice my web design skills. I am currently studyin Odin manual, and i building boiler plates, learning tags, attributes and references. 

it is important to remember that the web is just series of connected pages interacting with each other. Css which will come later is used to decorated the elements of the html files.

Enough for now lets dig in.!
